## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://wolt-picker.vercel.app)

[product-screenshot]: public/docs/site.png

Wolt is a Finnish food delivery company known for its excellent service across many countries, offering a wide variety of choices. This is the inspiration behind Wolt Picker, designed to simplify the decision-making process for users by providing an easy-to-navigate User Interface.

Please note, Wolt Picker is not an official product of Wolt and is in no way affiliated with the company.

### Built With

Given its modest scope, this project exclusively needs a frontend, leading to a more streamlined tech stack.

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Zustand

## Usage

Simply enter a new address when necessary, and if Wolt offers delivery to that location, you'll get random recommendations. With just one click, you can be redirected to the Wolt website to place your order.
